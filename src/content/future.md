Numerous projects have been created in order to improve access to parks and recreation, as well as supermarkets. These are important parts of the lived environment that could influence the health of many residents. An example of this is the <a href="https://bronxriver.org/about">Bronx River Alliance</a> which seeks to restore the Bronx River corridor. They have advocated for and constructed <a href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/highlights/bronx-river-greenway/then-and-now">new parks</a> that provide a space for outdoor recreation, which is a crucial given the lack of parks scene in the zoning maps.

This and future projects are crucial to influencing the social determinants of health.
