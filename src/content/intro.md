patient is in poor condition. Hours before, they had collapsed from a stroke. Initial diagnoses revealed that the patient is obese and has high cholestrol. As medical care continues to be administered to the patient, it is revealed that the cause of the cardiovascular complications is unmanaged diabetes. This untreated disease has manifested itself through damaged blood vessels and nerves that are essential to cardiovascular health (cite). The stroke was the result of a blood clot as a result of the diabetes and high cholesterol.

On the individual level, this case could be handled routinely. The patient could be diagnosed with diabetes and prescribed medicine and lifestyle changes to handle the cardiovascular diseases. Post-stroke rehabilitation could be provided as necessary. However, this was preventable.

The right approach could have been to educate the patient about healthier lifestyles and the importance of checking in with doctors when they were younger. Early action is essential to preventing diabetes. After all, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases states that the best way to prevent diabetes is “to make lifestyle changes that work for you long term” by losing weight, moving more, and eating healthier (cite). All this would have either prevented obesity and diabetes altogether or allowed them to find out sooner before the disease manifested itself with a stroke.

However, it’s not that simple.

While a healthy lifestyle may seem to be a simple individual choice, it is often the greater social and systemic factors that shape the health of individuals. According to the CDC, the conditions in the places where people live, learn, work and play affect a wide range of health outcomes. These conditions are known as the social determinants of health (cite).
