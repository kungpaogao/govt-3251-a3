    determinants of health as "the conditions in the environments where people
    are born, live, learn, work, play, worship, and age that affect a wide range
    of health, functioning, and quality-of-life outcomes and risks." They are
    grouped into five domainsâ€”click to learn the goal of each SDOH.
